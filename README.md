# Vector samples - Azure AI Search

This repository provides Python, C#, REST, and JavaScript code samples for [vector support](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/search/vector-search-overview) in Azure AI Search.

There are breaking changes from REST API version 2023-07-01-Preview to newer API versions. These breaking changes also apply to the Azure SDK beta packages targeting that REST API version. See [Upgrade REST APIs](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/search/search-api-migration) for migration guidance.

## Feature status

Vector support consists of generally available features and preview features.

| Feature | Status |
|---------|--------|
| [vector indexing](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/search/vector-search-how-to-create-index) | generally available (2023-11-01 and stable SDK packages) |
| [vector queries](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/search/vector-search-how-to-query) | generally available (2023-11-01 and stable SDK packages)|

| [vectorizer](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/search/vector-search-how-to-configure-vectorizer) in index schema | public preview (2023-10-01-preview and beta SDK packages) |

Preview features are available under [Supplemental Terms of Use](https://azure.microsoft.com/support/legal/preview-supplemental-terms/). 

## demo-dotnet samples

| Sample | Description | Status |
| ------ | ------------|--------|
| [DotNetVectorDemo](demo-dotnet/DotNetVectorDemo/readme.md) | A .NET console app that calls Azure OpenAI to vectorize data. It then calls Azure AI Search to create, load, and query vector data.| Generally available (GA) |
| [DotNetIntegratedVectorizationDemo](demo-dotnet/DotNetIntegratedVectorizationDemo/readme.md) | A .NET console app that calls Azure AI Search to create an index, indexer, data source, and skillset. An Azure Storage account provides the data. Azure OpenAI is called by the skillset during indexing, and again during query execution to vectorize text queries. | Public preview |

## demo-python samples

| Sample | Description | Status |
| ------ | ------------|--------|
| [demo-python/code/*.ipynb](demo-python/readme.md) |  A collection of nine notebooks that demonstrate aspects of vector search, including data chunking and vectorization of both text and image content. The most recent one, `custom-embeddings/azure-search-custom-vectorization-sample.ipynb`, demonstrates how to call custom embedding model from a skillset. | GA and preview | 

## demo-java samples

| Sample | Description | Status |
| ------ | ------------|--------|
| [demo-vectors](demo-java/demo-vectors/readme.md) | A Java console app that calls Azure OpenAI to vectorize data. It then calls Azure AI Search to create, load, and query vector data.| GA | 
| [demo-integrated-vectorization](demo-java/demo-integrated-vectorization/readme.md) | A Java console app that calls Azure AI Search to create an index, indexer, data source, and skillset. An Azure Storage account provides the data. Azure OpenAI is called by the skillset during indexing, and again during query execution to vectorize text queries. | GA and preview | 

## demo-javascript samples

| Sample | Description | Status |
| ------ | ------------|--------|
| [JavaScriptVectorDemo](demo-javascript/readme.md) | A single folder contains three code samples. The `azure-search-vector-sample.js` script calls just Azure OpenAI and is used to generate embeddings for fields in an index. The `docs-text-openai-embeddings.js` program is an end-to-end code sample that calls Azure OpenAI for embeddings and Azure AI Seach to create, load, and query an index that contains vectors. The `query-text-openai-embeddings.js` script generates an embedding for a vector query. | GA and preview | 

## postman-collection samples

| Sample | Description | Status |
| ------ | ------------|--------|
| [postman-collection](postman-collection/README.md)| Two separate Postman collections of REST API calls for generally available (2023-11-01) and preview (2023-10-01-preview) capabilities. GA version shows you how to create, load, and query vector and non-vector content in an index. Preview version demonstrates integrated data chunking and vectorization through indexers and skillsets. Use the [Postman app](https://www.postman.com/downloads/) for these samples. | GA and preview |
